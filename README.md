# Air-Passenger-Forecasting-Using-SARIMA

### Project overview

This notebook performs an end-to-end time series analysis using the classic AirPassengers dataset. There are some steps which are mentioned below:
1. Data exploration and visualization
2. Trend and seasonality decomposition
3. Stationarity check using the Augmented Dickey-Fuller test
4. ARIMA vs SARIMA model comparison (based on AIC/BIC)
5. Forecasting for future months
6. Evaluation with MAE, RMSE, and MAPE
### Model performance 
- RMSE: 18.49
- MAE: 13.93
- MAPE: 3.1%

The SARIMA model shows strong forecasting performance with low error rates.
